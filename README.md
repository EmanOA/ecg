Electrocardiogram (ECG)
===

This repository is for work on an open source electrocardiogram
that costs less than USD$500, and is equivalent to a gold standard
premium electrocardiogram. It should be capable of producing signals
similar to premium brand devices.

This device's engineering is done by [IRNAS](https://irnas.eu).

Funding support is from [The Shuttleworth Foundation](https://www.shuttleworthfoundation.org/),
[Division of Emergency Medicine, London Health Sciences Centre (EMLondon)](https://emlondon.ca/), and the Faculty of Medicine at The University of Western Ontario.
